As a user, I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
As a user, I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie 
foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods 
(less than 500 calories).
I want to click a food to edit its name, details or
 calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 
 100 calories instead of 365)
